# Project Name: Prevent Duplicate Goals in Web Application

## Objective:
The objective of this project was to prevent the duplication of goals entered into a web application. The goal input field allows users to enter new goals, and the program should check if the entered goal already exists in the list. If the goal exists, it should alert the user, and if not, it should add the goal to the list.

## Challenges:
I encountered challenges in preventing the duplication of goals in the web application. Initially, I attempted to compare the input directly with the text content of existing goals to determine if it already existed. However, this approach did not effectively prevent duplicates, as it compared the entire text content rather than individual goals.

## Solutions:
To address the duplication problem, I researched and learned about JavaScript array methods such as `includes()` and `split()`. After gaining a better understanding of these methods, I realized that I needed to search across my array of existing goals rather than treating it as a single string. By splitting the text content into individual goals and then using the `includes()` method to compare them with the input, I was able to effectively prevent duplicates.

## Improvements:
In future projects, I aim to further improve my understanding of JavaScript array methods and their applications. Additionally, I plan to explore more advanced techniques for handling data manipulation and user input validation in web applications. This will help me enhance the functionality and user experience of my projects while minimizing potential issues such as duplicate entries.
